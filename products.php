                Pumps 2000 offers a wide range of patented, non-metallic Pneumatic dual-diaphragm pumps that out-perform and outlast all others.</p>
            <p>
                Pumps 2000 pumps are made of engineered plastics, operate lubrication free and are light weight and manual handling friendly. Several patented features make 
                it possible for Pumps 2000 to offer market-leading low life cycle cost while delivering outstanding performance in the harshest environments as these pumps were 
                designed specifically to handle abrasive, solid-laden and corrosive fluids.
            </p>
            
            <p>The product ranges includes applications for underground use, slurry or clean fluid transfer, a range of chemicals, continuous 
                or occasional explosive atmospheres, fixed or portable installations. Whether your application is related to General Industry, Marine, Mining, Building and 
                Construction, Food Processing, Chemicals or Pollution Control, there's a Pumps 2000 solution that's right for your particular needs.</p>
            
            <h2>Key characteristics and advantages include:</h2>
            
            <h4>Large Particle Handling</h4>
            <p>Pumps 2000's unique slurry pumps allow particles of various types and sizes to pass through the pump unobstructed. If there's enough liquid to carry the solids, Pumps 2000 slurry pumps get the job done. To see a pump in action, <a class="youtube" href="download/2 inch slurry - particle handling demo.wmv" title="Pumping Rocks and Water">view the demonstration video</a>.</p>
            
            <h4>Long-Life Operation</h4>
            <p>Pumps 2000 uses the toughest engineering-grade plastics to give your pumps longer working life under the harshest conditions. By using only the best materials and patented design components, you get trouble-free operation for extended periods of time. Because Pumps 2000 pumps are made of plastic and contain stainless steel components that are ideal for corrosive environments, you'll save on maintenance and labor costs, as well as vehicle transportation and maintenance, while improving the overall efficiency of your operation.</p>
            
            <h4>Light Weight</h4>
            <p>Pumps 2000's air-operated double diaphragm pumps reduce the risk of lifting-related workplace injuries. Their light weight allows you to re-locate and maintain pumps quickly and easily. Keep your workers safe and happy with equipment and systems from Pumps 2000 America.</p>
            
            <h4>Efficient Air Usage</h4>
            <p>With a lower air consumption-to-output ratio, Pumps 2000 air-operated double diaphragm pumps do a better job using less air than traditional pumps. This benefit can lead to savings on your compressor and leave you with "excess" air that can be used elsewhere in your operation.</p>
            
            <h4>Lubrication-Free</h4>
            <p>Pumps 2000 pumps use plastic components that are low-wear and low-friction to give you lubrication-free, long-life operation. Save on oil, time and labor expenses used to maintain lubricators. Also save on spare parts and protect the environment from oil pollution.</p>

            <h4>Setup Versatility</h4>
            <p>Our high-suction lift in Pumps 2000 air-operated double diaphragm pumps gives you maximum flexibility when configuring pumping systems. With Pumps 2000 equipment and systems, you can keep the pumps away from high-traffic areas while continuing to get reliable priming and performance, even when they're fully submerged. We also offer assistance with pump selection and setup.</p>
            
            <h4>Ease of Maintenance</h4>
            <p>Pumps 2000's air-operated double diaphragm pumps contain a minimal number of components. Because they contain few parts, you'll have no headaches when it comes to maintenance.</p>
