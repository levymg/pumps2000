                <p>Megator manufacture a range of oil skimmers designed to remove pollutants and nuisance media from the surface of calm or sheltered waters and shore line areas.  Ideal for emergency oil spill clean up situations.</p>
                
                <p>If the standard range of oil skimmers are not suitable, Megator can also manufacture bespoke oil skimmers to meet your individual specifications.</p>
                
                <h2>Floating Weir Oil Skimmers</h2>

                <p>Floating weir oil skimmers float on the surface of water where the highest concentration of oil is located.  Floating weir oil skimmers consist of a number of floats and a central intake weir.  The height of the intake weir is adjustable, allowing the oil skimmer to efficiently remove thin or thick layers of oil or pollutant.</p>

                <p>Floating weir oil skimmers are suitable for permanent installation or emergency oil spill response situations, due to their light weight, ease of transportation and one person operation.</p>
                
                <p>Floating weir oil skimmers are suitable for use with a self priming pump or a gravity feed application.</p>

                <h2>Rope Mop Oil Skimmers</h2>

                <p>Rope mop oil skimmers are suitable for permanent or temporary installation and consist of a drive unit and a length of oleophillic (oil attracting) rope.  The rope is driven over the surface of the oil.  The oil sticks to the rope and is carried back to the drive unit where it is removed.</p>

                <p>The Megator Rope mop oil skimmers recover floating oils from the surface of water using a rope mop. The floating rope is driven over the surface of the oil by a drive unit which also squeezes the oil out of the rope for recovery. Rope mop skimmers use a unique fibrillated polypropylene rope which is oleophilic (attracts oil) to remove the floating oils in a wide range of spill clean-up or industrial applications and have proven their reliability in thousands of applications worldwide. The rope mop system is ideal for recovering oil over small or large areas, in separators or pits, harbours and dams in any climate and in a complete range of viscosities.</p>
                
                <h3>Stand &amp; Separating Tank</h3>
                
                <p>The optional stand and separating tank allows the skimmer to be hung over the area which needs to be skimmed whilst the compact integral separating tank separates and returns any water picked up by the rope mop. Only pure oil leaves the separator for re-refining or disposal.</p>
                
                <h3>Rope mops</h3>

                <p><strong>White</strong> - Used for the skimming of light and medium oils. This softer rope gives optimum performance and recovery and is bulkier than the blue rope.</p>

                <p><strong>Blue</strong> - Used for the skimming of heavy oils. This coarse rope gives better skimming and grip in the drive unit and has a flat profile.</p>
                
                <p>Oilskim ropes are manufactured from fibrillated polypropylene which has a large surface area and ensures excellent oil recovery rates. Oilskim ropes are sold in multiples of 5 m.</p>

                <p>Floating Guide Pulleys allow the skimmer to skim larger surface areas by guiding the oilskim rope over the surface of the oil. The floating guide pulley floats independently and need only be tied to a wall or other fastening point. If the level in the separator fluctuates then a sliding anchor pillar can be used.</p>
