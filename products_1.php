            <h2>Pumps, Pumping Systems &amp; Pollution Control Solutions that solve problems &amp; operate efficiently saving time &amp; money</h2>
            
            <p>Our innovative and unique pumps were designed originally for some of the most demanding applications. When it comes to pumps, pumping systems &amp; pollution control solutions, we have the equipment and know-how to solve problems, maximize productivity and reduce maintenance costs.</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you're operating in a <strong>mining, industrial, marine, or pollution control environment</strong>, we can help meet your pumping requirements. Our pumps, pumping systems and pollution control solutions have continually exceeded our customers' expectation for quality, performance and reliability.</p>
            
            <h3>Our wide selection of <strong>positive displacement pump designs</strong> includes:</h3>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="sliding-shoe-pump.php">Sliding Shoe</a></strong> &mdash; Originally developed for mining and marine applications, it is a unique self-priming, positive displacement pump that runs safely under dry suction, has low shear and emulsification characteristics, high suction lift, and is self-compensating for wear. Ideally suited for water or varying viscosities, including clean and dirty liquids, the Sliding Shoe Pump has a user-friendly, simple design that allows for front-cover access to few working parts for easy MIP (Maintenance In Place).</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="http://www.pumps2000america.com" target="_blank">Pumps 2000 Pneumatic Dual Diaphragm</a></strong> &mdash; Originally designed for harsh mining applications, this pump is guaranteed to out-perform the competition due to its unique patented self-cleaning slurry and ball valves, double-hinged diaphragms and modular, wear-resistant air motor components. The Pumps 2000 moves dirty liquids and slurries effectively with no stoppages, is lighter in weight for easy mobility and consumes less compressed air than comparable models.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="rotary-lobe-pump.php">Rotary Lobe</a></strong> &mdash; Uniquely designed for high-pressure, high-viscosity, and abrasives- and solids-laden stationary pumping applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="salarollpump.php">Salarollpump</a></strong> &mdash; This portable pumping system with patented peristaltic pump design features super suction, which enables it to process high-viscous, abrasive, and debris-laden liquids. Developed originally for shoreline/pipeline oil spill cleanup, its durability, unlimited discharge capability and portability make it an effective tool for chemical spills, submerged oil recovery, high-viscous skimmer offloading and industrial, marine and offshore tank cleaning. It is also an alternative to expensive vacuum trucks.</p>
            
            <h3>Megator's extensive line of <strong>accessories and packaged systems</strong> includes:</h3>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="oil-skimmers.php">Weir Skimmers</a></strong> &mdash; Designed to remove pollutants and nuisance media from the surface of calm or sheltered waters and shoreline areas.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="floating-strainers.php">Dolphin Floating Suction Strainers</a></strong> &mdash; Provide excellent pump protection. Their intake draws from just below the surface, preventing floating debris, settled solids or other contaminants from entering pumps and will not become buried when grounded in shallow water.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="floating-oil-booms.php">Floating Booms</a></strong> &mdash; Lightweight, easy-to-use booms for calm or sheltered waters to contain oil, or to serve as a barrier against floating debris.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="oil-dispersant-systems.php">Dispersant Spray Systems</a></strong> &mdash; Portable lightweight sets that can be quickly mounted on tugs, offshore supply vessels and other pollution control craft responding to marine emergency oil spills.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="oil-water-separators.php">Oil/Water Separators</a></strong> &mdash; Remove virtually all free and dispersed oil from wastewater effluent containing less than a 10mg/1 ratio of oil droplets greater than 20 microns with a specific gravity of 0.89 or less. These coalescing oil/water separators are the perfect compliment to Megator's oil recovery units.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="oil-spill-trailer.php">Spill Response Trailers</a></strong> &mdash; A complete package of response equipment that enables personnel to deal effectively with small or medium land-based pollution oil spill situations at a moment's notice.</p>  
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="truxor.php">Truxor</a></strong> &mdash; This Multi-Purpose Amphibious Vehicle is equipped with the Salarollpump and brush skimmer for oil spill cleanup. Its superior amphibious properties make it ideal for working in and around the borders between land and water. Minimal ground pressure prevents damage to land so it's well suited to nature preserves and other sensitive sites where equipment has difficulty maneuvering. The broad assortment of Truxor's many tools give it tremendous flexibility.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="oil-recovery-unit.php">Recovery Unit</a></strong> &mdash; A unique packaged pump and skimmer system designed to recover oil from water in all industrial applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="blue"><a href="system-3.php">System 3</a></strong> &mdash; This pre-engineered, pre-packaged, ready-to-install, self-contained system is ideal for oil skimming and oil/water separation.</p>
