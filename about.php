            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <h2>From Australian Mines to Applications Worldwide</h2>
            <p>Pumps 2000 was established in Australia in 1989 to offer pumps capable of handling abrasive, solid-laden and corrosive fluids in underground mining environments, and to create an alternative to the heavy, maintenance-intensive diaphragm pumps that were used predominantly in mines. These pumps featured low weight, as well as improved pump life and performance.</p>
			<p>Pumps 2000 America was established in 2007 to market Pumps 2000 products and solutions throughout North and South America. Today, our pumps continue to be used in coal and hard-rock mining throughout North and South America, as well as in General Industry, Marine, Building &amp; Construction, Food Processing, Chemicals and Pollution Control applications.</p>
            <p>Pumps 2000 pumps are assembled and tested at our facility in Pittsburgh PA, USA. From this location, we also provide comprehensive technical support to our distributors, agents and end-users across North and South America, and operate a service facility and warehouse to ensure fast delivery of pumps and spares.</p>
            <p>Several patented features make it possible for Pumps 2000 to offer market-leading low life cycle cost, while handling difficult applications. A number of products are currently under development.</p>
            <p>All Pumps 2000 products are certified in accordance with ATEX.</p>

            <p>The use of injection molding has given Pumps 2000 greater freedom in material composition and has led to the development of lubrication-free pumps and our own 
                plastic blends. Our unique combination of in-house R &amp; D and manufacturing enables us to offer pumps and pumping systems which are technically superior and 
                significantly higher quality than our competitors.</p>
