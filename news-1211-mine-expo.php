            <p>Megator - Pumps 2000 America joined together with its colleagues from Australia and distributors from around the world to exhibit at the International Mine Expo in Las Vegas. This Mining venue served as an ideal platform to launch two new products and visit with our customers and sales partners. Introduced were the High Volume 3" (HV3") and 1 &frac12;" (40mm) Bolted AODD designs. The HV3" is a unique 3" design with a 400 GPM flow rate that offers superior volume along all points of its curve. This new design provides mining an alternative to electric submersibles and centrifugals transfer pumps. Air is significantly more economical than maintaining and installing electric pumps. Although the outer chamber and ports are 3", we utilize our 4" air motor. As a result the pump volume is significantly greater at 400gpm and produces a significantly higher volume at every point on the curve. </p>
