            <p>For the third consecutive year, Megator/Salarollpump participated in the Alaska North Slope Spill Response Team's (NSSRT) Oil Spill Response in Ice training course. The session took place during the week of January 27-31 at the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers' Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, NH. Megator/Salarollpump gave classroom training and demonstrations of the company's Salarollpump System. Alaska Clean Seas (ACS), the North Slope oil spill response cooperative, oversaw training of the NSSRT. Throughout the week, NSSRT members were given unique opportunities to train with oil spill response equipment for handling Alaska North Slope Crude Oil in realistic sea ice and broken ice conditions.</p>
